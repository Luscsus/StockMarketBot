# stock-market-bot-v4
The goal of this project was to automate stock trading, it would use https://alpaca.markets/ to get the stock price and as the stock broker. It would buy stocks when their price was lower that the average price of that week and then it would sell the stock when the price was higher than when it was bought by a margin.
# Problems with the project:
1. The first and biggest problem is the fact that you can only use https://alpaca.markets/ in the USA. So when I learned that was the case I abandoned the project(I live in Europe).
2. The second problem is that I got flaged as a day trader, which meant that I couldn't buy and sell the same stock in the same day. If I wanted to day trade I would need at least 
 25 000$ in my account. (which I dont have).
# Fixing the problems:
1. To fix the first problem I could try to find another stock broker that would let me use an api, be able to trade in Europe, with no commision, no minimal deposit. But I didn't feel like searching for the right one.
2. To fix the second problem I tried buying stock on day 1 and then selling them on day 2, then buying them again on day 3 and so on.
